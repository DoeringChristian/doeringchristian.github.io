  - >
    Hi, I'm Christian!
  - >
    I'm a graduate student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the <a
    href="https://www.tum.de/">Technical University of Munich </a>
    (<abbr>TUM</abbr>).<br />Currently I'm writing my Masters Thesis as an
    exchange student at the <i>Swiss Federal Institute of Technology
    (<strong>EPFL</strong>)</i>. Previously I interned at both Huawei's
    <nobr>Munich Research Center</nobr> and <nobr>NVIDIA Switzerland</nobr>,
    where I gained experience in Neural as well as Differentiable Rendering.
    During these internships I worked with the <nobr><strong>Mitsuba
    3</strong></nobr> rendering framework, and developed a <a
    href="https://drjit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/freeze.html">function level
    caching feature</a> for the <strong>Dr.Jit</strong> just-in-time compiler.

      "A function level caching feature for the Dr.Jit compiler. By annotating a
      function with a decorator, we record and replay kernels, skipping tracing
      and compilation of kernels."
